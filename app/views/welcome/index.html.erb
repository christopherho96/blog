              <p>My name is Christopher Ho and I am currently a 3A Mechnical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
              <p>Like many of my fellow engineering colleagues, I have a passion for creating something new, innovative and unique. I am selft-taught iOS developer currently employed as a mobile software developer for a start-up company. My first iOS application I built was a mini-game application called PoopScoop. Since then, I have branched out to more complicated and applicable iOS projects to the real world.</p>
              <p>My hobbies consist of basketball, travelling and being a fitness enthusiast. In addition, I am addicted to poker. If you ever need an extra player at your table, send me a message!</p>
